# Numerical ability

### LCM and HCF

- $\text{LCM of fractions} = \large{\frac{\text{LCM of numerators}}{\text{HCF of denominators}}}$

- $\text{HCF of fractions} = \large{\frac{\text{HCF of numerators}}{\text{LCM of denominators}}}$

- $\text{A.B} = \text{HCF(A, B)}.\text{LCM(A, B)}$

- If remainder is given, see if adding or subtracting it from LCM/HCF according to question makes sense.

- Includes questions with keywords like find "maximum/greatest" or "minimum/least" etc.

### Simplification

- $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a + b)$
- $(a - b)^3 = a^3 - b^3 - 3ab(a-b)$
- $a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2+b^2-ab)$
- $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+b^2+ab)$
- $(a+b+c)^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2(ab+bc+ca)$
- $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 -3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-bc-ca)$
- Use things like rationalization, taking common from repeating series etc to simplify.

### Fractions

- Convert repeating numbers to fraction -

  - $\text{0.35}\overline{23}$ = $\large{\frac{\text{Whole number once} - \text{Digits after decimal not repeating}}{\text{9 m times followed by 0 n times}} = \frac{3523 - 35}{9900} = \frac{3488}{9900}}$ where m = Number of digits after decimal(non repeating) and n = Number of digits after decimal(repeating)

- If $\large{\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}}$, then $\large{\frac{a+b}{a-b} = \frac{c+d}{c-d}}$ by Componendo-Dividendo rule.

- Solving complex decimal equations -

  - Eg - $105.153 - 4.142 - 100.8 - 0.053$ can be solved by first calculating all numbers before decimal and then solving all after decimal.
  - $105 - 4 - 100 - 0 = 1$
  - $153 - 142 - 800 - 053 = -842$ but since its after decimal it will $-0.842$
  - $1 - 0.842 = 0.158$

- Finding largest/smallest fraction -

  - Consider two fractions, cross multiply them and compare result. If LHS > RHS, left fraction is greater else right. For multiple fractions, form pairs, get largest/smallest from all pairs and then compare those to find global largest/smallest.

- Finding increasing order of fractions -

  - If $deno > nume$ and $deno - nume$ is **SAME** and consisent among fractions, we say that **SMALLER THE NUMERATOR, SMALLER THE FRACTION. GREATER THE NUMERATOR, GREATER THE FRACTION**
  - If after arranging the numerators in ascending order, the $nume$ and $deno$ increases by fixed values, we say that **SMALLER THE NUMERATOR, SMALLER THE FRACTION. GREATER THE NUMERATOR, GREATER THE FRACTION**. The values by which num. and denom. increase might or might not be same.

- Solving mixed fractions -
  - Eg - $\large{8\frac{1}{6} + 5\frac{1}{8} + 4\frac{2}{3}}$ can be solved by first calculating all numbers sepeartely and then solving all fractions.
  - $8 + 5 + 4 = 17$
  - $\large{\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{23}{24}}$
  - $\text{Ans} = 17\frac{23}{24}$

- Circle/Semi-circle
  - Length of arc = $\large{\frac{2.\pi.r.\theta}{360}}$

  - Area of sector = $\large{\frac{\pi.r^2.\theta}{360}}$

- Triangle
  - Area of equilateral triangle = $\large{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}}.a^2$


### Mixture & Alligation

- Finding ratio of quantities when mixed and one is costly than other
  - Find the average
  - Subtract both of them from average
  - This ratio is the answer

### Time and Work

- Invert
  - $n = \large{\frac{1}{n}}$
  - Total work in 30 days, then in one day, $\large{\frac{1}{30}}$ amount of work

- $N = \sqrt{\text{Extra days taken by P} . \text{Extra days taken by Q}}$ where $N = \text{Total time taken by P and Q together}$

### Speed, Distance and Time

- A walks from point P to point Q and at same time B walks from Q to P. After passing each other, say A takes 'x' hours to complete the journey and B takes 'y' hours to complete the journey. Then, we can say that -
  - $Speed_A : Speed_B = \sqrt{y} : \sqrt{x} $

### Profit and Loss

- $\text{Profit \%age} = \large{\frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}}}*100$
- $\text{Loss \%age} = \large{\frac{\text{Loss}}{\text{Cost Price}}}*100$
- $\text{Selling price} = (100 + Profit \%age)\%.\text{Cost Price}$
  - Given CP = 500 and want to sell at 10\% profit, we can find SP
  - $SP = (100 + 10)\% * 500 = \text{110\% of 500} = Rs. 550$
- $\text{Selling price} = (100 - Loss \%age)\%.\text{Cost Price}$
  - Given CP = 500 and incurred 20\% loss, we can find SP
  - $SP = (100 - 20)\% * 500 = \text{80\% of 500} = Rs. 400$
- When 2 objects are sold with same SP and equal profit and loss \%age (say A), person will always suffer a **LOSS**
  - $\text{Loss \%age} = \large{\frac{A^2}{100}}$

### Averages

- In questions where an item is removed and averages changes, remember it changes for **ALL** items.
- Questions where one item is replaced by another, the new item has to compensate for average increase for all items.

### AP

- $a_n = a + (n-1).d$
- $d = \large{\frac{b-a}{n+1}}$
- $n = \large{ \frac{ \text{Last term} - \text{First term} }{d} + 1 }$
- $S_n = \large{\frac{n}{2}}.(2a + (n-1).d) = \large{\frac{n}{2}.(\text{ first term } + \text{ last term })}$
- $\text{Arithmetic Mean} = \large{\frac{S_n}{n}}$
- Add/Sub/Mul/Div all terms of AP by same number, result is also AP
- Add two APs, result is also AP
- Use mcq options to find answer by elimination.
- Questions where sum of terms of AP is given, try taking terms such that most of d is cancelled out.

### GP

- $a_n = a.r^{n-1}$
- $d = \large{\frac{b}{a}}^\frac{1}{n+1}$
- $S_n = \large{\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}}; r<1 = \large{\frac{\text{First term} - (\text{Last term} * r)}{1-r}}$
- $S_n = \large{\frac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1}}; r>1 = \large{\frac{(\text{Last term} * r) - \text{First term}}{r-1}}$
- $S_\infty = \large{\frac{a}{1-r}}; |r| < 1$
- Geometric mean:
  - Odd number of terms in GP: Middle element is GM
  - Even number of terms in GP: $\sqrt{a_n.a}$ to find GM
- Mul/Div all terms of GP by same number, result is also GP
- Raise each term by same power, result is also GP
- Multiply two GP series, result is GP series
- Log of each term in GP series, result is **AP series**
- Questions where product of terms of GP is given, try taking terms such that most of r is cancelled out.

### Calendar

- Extra days -> Odd days
- Normal year -> 365 days = 52 weeks + 1 odd day
  - **Normal year begins and ends on same day**
- Leap year -> 366 days = 52 weeks + 2 odd days
  - **Leap year ends on the next day it began at start**
- Checking if a year is a leap year:
  - For non-century years (eg: 1756, 1832, 1888, 1929): Check if last two digits are completely divisible by 4
  - For century years (eg: 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900): Check if year is divisible by 400
- Century leap years (eg: 1600, 2000, 2400) have **0 ODD DAYS**

- No. of odd days:

| No. of years   | Odd days    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| 100   | 5   |
| 200   | 3   |
| 300   | 1   |
| 400   | 0   |

- Day based on no. of odd days

| No. of odd days   | Day    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| 0   | Sunday |
| 1   | Monday   |
| 2   | Tuesday   |
| 3   | Wednesday   |
